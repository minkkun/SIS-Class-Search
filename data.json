The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit. This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population. Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates. Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years. Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.

The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit. This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population. Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates. Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years. Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.

Students enrolled in MATH 478 will make arrangements with the instructor to attend additional lectures and complete additional assignments addressing mathematical topics related to the course. Recommended preparation: MATH 223 and MATH 224 or BIOL 300 and BIOL 306. Offered as BIOL 378, COGS 378, MATH 378, BIOL 478, CSDS 478, EBME 478, ECSE 478, MATH 478 and NEUR 478.", "semester": "Spring 2023"}, "CSDS (Computer and Data Sciences) 486: Quantum Computing, Information, and DevicesJesse Berezovsky, Christos Papachristou, Stanislaw Szarek, Shuai Xus23": {"code": "CSDS  486", "title": "Quantum Computing, Information, and Devices", "professor": "Jesse Berezovsky, Christos Papachristou, Stanislaw Szarek, Shuai Xu", "description": "An introduction to the math, physics, engineering, and computer science underlying the rapidly emerging fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum devices. The course is taught by a group of faculty from physics, engineering, computer science, and math, and is geared towards students with diverse backgrounds and interests in these fields. Students will select a concentration in one of these four areas, and the coursework, while still covering all topics, will be adjusted to focus on the selected area in the most detail. Note that the listed prerequisites depend on choice of concentration. Topics will include: 1. (Mathematics) Introduction to linear algebra, convex geometry, fundamental theory of quantum information. 2. (Physics) Introduction to the quantum mechanics of two-level systems (qubits). Survey of physics and materials for qubit technologies. 3. (Computer Science) Basic quantum gates and circuits, introduction to the theory of algorithms, survey of quantum algorithms. 4. (Engineering) Quantum architectures, mapping algorithms onto circuits. The course consists of lectures, homework, and group projects. Group projects will aim to synthesize the diverse backgrounds of the students and instructors to capture the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Students taking the course for graduate credit will complete an additional literature research project and presentation, in addition to enhanced problem sets.

These models can be applied to a wide variety of settings from data analysis to machine learning to robotics. The models allow intelligent systems to represent uncertainties in an environment or problem space in a compact way and reason intelligently in a way that makes optimal use of available information and time. The course covers directed and undirected probabilistic graphical models, latent variable models, associated exact and approximate inference algorithms, and learning in both discrete and continuous problem spaces.
